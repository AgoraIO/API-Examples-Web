# Sample projects for Agora RTC Web SDK 4.x

_English | [简体中文](README.cn.md)_

## Overview

This repository contains sample projects using the Agora RTC Web SDK 4.x.

<hr>

**If you are still not familiar with Agora RTC Web SDK 4.x, please follow [our community interactive tutorial](https://agorawebsdktutorialenusmain.gtsb.io/) to quickly understand the SDK and use CodePen iframes to call the SDK in your browser.**

<hr>

The Web SDK 4.x refactors the Web SDK 3.x. Based on the features of 3.x, 4.x fully optimizes the internal architecture of the SDK and provides more flexible and easy-to-use APIs.

Compared to the Web SDK 3.x, the Web SDK 4.x has the following advantages:

- Uses promises for asynchronous operations, which improves the robustness and readability of your code.
- Supports TypeScript.
- Replaces the Stream object with Track objects for separate and flexible control over audio and video.
- Improves the channel event notification mechanism, making it easier for you to deal with reconnection.
- Provides more accurate and comprehensive error codes for troubleshooting.
